This chapter will help you getting ready to work on the Quadrocopter. If you are already comfortable with the project then you might skip this chapter. This document aims at students who (like us when we started) have no clue whats going on.It will show you all the steps in order to compile the code, connect it to the Quadrocopter, and all the other stuff I dont know what we are going to to so it works. But you can find it here.\\
