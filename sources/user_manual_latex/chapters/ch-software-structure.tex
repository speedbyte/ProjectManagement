\section{Software layer and structure concept}
\label{sec:software:layerAndStruct}

One of the core goals of the layering concept is the maximization of code re-usability. Since major parts of the software is intended to run on multiple platforms, it is mandatory to keep a strict separation between hardware-dependent and hardware-independent software. 

Furthermore, since the hardware is highly modularized, the software shall reflect this modularity as close as possible to ease the interchangeability of sensors. In detail, the modularity encompasses the microprocessor platform (in this project: \texttt{Raspberry Pi B+}) and several extension boards equipped with sensors. In table \ref{tab:layer:hw_sw_comp}, a detailed comparison between hardware modularity and software layering is shown.

To achieve the goal of a maximal code re-usability, the software shall be structured in four general layers (see fig.\ref{fig:layer:layer_graph}). Within each \textbf{\textit{Layer}}, several \textbf{\textit{Functional Units}} are defined in order to divide the software into logically separable modules.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textemphs{Application Layer (app)}\\
				This layer contains all high-level software that is necessary for the control of the quadrocopter. Control loops, position hold control, autonomous landing control and supervising functions are here located.
	\item \textemphs{Signal Processing Layer (sig)}\\
				In order to give a flexible framework for filtering and data fusion, a dedicated layer is introduced. The raw sensor data shall be filter (e.g. lowpass filtering). In a second step, the received data shall be fusioned in order to achieve an robust and reliable orientation representation of the quadrocopter.
	\item \textemphs{Hardware Abstraction Layer (hal)}\\
				Since all software of the \texttt{Application Layer (app)} and \texttt{Signal Processing Layer (sig)} shall be system independent, the \texttt{Hardware Abstraction Layer} provides all drivers for the used sensors and extension boards. The interface towards the \texttt{Signal Processing Layer (sig)} will generalize the data flow, independent of the used sensors.\\
				The interfaces towards the \texttt{Low-Level Driver Layer (LLD)} will be called \textbf{Low-Level Driver Interfaces (LLD\_IF)}. These interfaces shall abstract the access the low-level drivers that are usually microprocessor-specific to the used hardware platform (here: Raspberry Pi B+).
				%Thus, all implemented HAL drivers may be used without any adaptions in the core code on different hardware platform in future projects.
	\item \textemphs{Low-Level Driver Layer (LLD)}\\
				The \texttt{Low-Level Driver Layer} contains all drivers needed for low-level data communication like \texttt{UART}, \texttt{I2C} or \texttt{SPI}. For the scope of this project (MasterQuad 2015), all needed low-lever drivers are already provided by the chosen operating system.
