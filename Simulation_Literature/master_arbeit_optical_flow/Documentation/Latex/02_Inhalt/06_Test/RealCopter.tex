\subsection{Real quadrocopter test}\label{chapter_RealCopterTest}

As described in chapter \ref{chapter_HILTest}, the Hardware In the Loop tests did not work. So to test the new state space controller directly in the quadrocopter, the rotor blades were removed. Starting with the first test, everything went well. It was not possible to fly with the quadrocopter, but to travel on the ground. After several hours of parameter tuning, by moving the poles and adjusting the maximum angles, the quadrocopter seems to be able to fly. But to get a perfect behavior in the air, additional hours have to be spend in fine tuning.
