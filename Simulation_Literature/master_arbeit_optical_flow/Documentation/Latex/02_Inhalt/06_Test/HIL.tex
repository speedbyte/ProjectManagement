\subsection{Hardware In the Loop test}\label{chapter_HILTest}

After the successful tests of the Matlab/Simulink state space controller, the controller was implemented in C (chapter \ref{chapter_IMPLC}). In this step, the real quadrocopter including the controller is connected to the computer with the Matlab/Simulink model on it. The actuating variables are calculated by the real hardware and software in the quadrocopter. Unfortunately it was not possible to get a stable connection between the quadrocopter and the computer. So that part of the testing had to be skipped, after several days of trying to get the connection stable. Because of the good results with the simulation, it was possible to continue with the tests in the real quadrocopter without performing the Hardware In the Loop tests.
