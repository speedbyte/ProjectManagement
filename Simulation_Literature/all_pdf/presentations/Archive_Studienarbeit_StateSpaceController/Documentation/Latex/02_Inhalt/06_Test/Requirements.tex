\subsection{Requirements}\label{chapter_REQUIREMENTS}

In summary there are not many requirements, that really have to be fulfilled. Most of the requirements that are mentioned in this document in multiple chapters are imprecise or variable. This short chapter collects all the requirements to allow structured tests.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The controller has to operate without of additional sensors.
	\item The transient effect should be fast 'enough'.
	\item There must not be overshooting of the controlled variables.
	\item The system has to be stable/must not be oscillating.
	\item The values of the controlled variables must be reasonable.
\end{enumerate}

Requirement No. 1 is already fulfilled, because with the existing sensors, it is possible, to measure all state variables, so no additional sensors are needed.
The following tests check the fulfillment of the other four requirements.
