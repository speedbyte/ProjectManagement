Imagine a remote control with four slide sticks is passed to you. On the floor, in front of you, there is a helicopter without tail rotor, but with four head rotors. Each slide control controls the engine speed of one rotor. Would you be able to steer this flying object? Certainly not. But with the help of a controller you will be able to steer this flying object, called quadrocopter.
This research paper deals with the development of a controller for a quadrocopter. It was realized in SS2011 at the University of Applied Sciences Esslingen. The goal of this project was to design and implement a state space controller for a quadrocopter in MATLAB Simulink and we are glad to report success.

We want to thank our tutor, B.Eng. Dionysios Satikidis, for the assistance during the project, as well as Prof. Dr.-Ing. Hermann Kull for the occasionally hints and his manuscript. Last but not least, we want to thank Prof. Dr. Jörg Friedrich, our examinor for permitting this project.
