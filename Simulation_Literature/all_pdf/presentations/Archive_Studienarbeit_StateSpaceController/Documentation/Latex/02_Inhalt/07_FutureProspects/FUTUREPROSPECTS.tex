\section{Future prospects}\label{chapter_FUTUREPROSPECTS}

Although the state space controller works perfectly in the simulation, it is still necessary to spend some fine tuning to the controller in C. Also it is unknown, how the controller handles disturbances like wind. Maybe it is reasonable, to spend the state space controller a superimposed PI controller to avoid control deviation.\\
An other point of the future prospects is to reduce the number of sensors. A first try is to simply delete some sensors and readjust the state space controller. The second idea is to implement an observer to simulate some state variables in real time on the microcontroller.\\
Anyway - the goal of this student project is achieved and provides a basis for further quadrocopter projects.
