\chapter{Deliverables and Outcomes}

The expected outcome of the Master's Thesis is the research and feasibility study
of the distributed position correction scheme which has to reflect the
improvements of drift eliminations. This has to be realized with a simulation
prototype which reflects behaviour of the real components and allows a look
insight the complete system. Another outcome has to be the image processing
application at the base station which has to collaborate with the simulation.
